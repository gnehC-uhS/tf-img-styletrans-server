# Tensorflow Image Style Transfer Server

This is a project I worked on by myself during my after-work time in the summer of 2019. It demos a Fast Style Transfer. A set of 'vanilla-ish' Generative Adversarial Networks in ```model.py```is used to transform the content image to any given style image. The demo is available on: https://faststyle.herokuapp.com/.

### Requirement ###

- Python >=3.4
  - TensorFlow >=1.4
  
### For production:
- Run ```pip install -r requirements.txt ``` in your command line, before running ```python3 main.py```. This updates necessary packages.
